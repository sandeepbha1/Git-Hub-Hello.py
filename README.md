Many changes have been implemented in the helloWorld.py.

Changes have also been made to the Brach name (it use to be called issue-1) - which this is considered a good name, 
it was more informative to rename this as helloWorld.py-updates-and-progress (therefore a group of people are more 
likely to know of the overall objectives if this was a team project).

The most recent change that was made within the helloWorld.py is one further variable name, and one futher print request
to introduce the user.
