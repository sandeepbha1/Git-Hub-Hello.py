Many changes have been implemented in the helloWorld.py. 

Changes have also been made to the Brach name (it use to be called issue-1) - which this is considered a good name, it was more informative to rename this as 
helloWorld.py-updates-and-progress (therefore a group of people are more likely to know of the overall objectives if this was a team project).
